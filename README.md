# Patrol Shift Bid Scheduler

## About
Patrol Shift Bid Scheduler is a web application designed to aid in scheduling patrol officers using a seniority-based bidding system. At a basic level, it allows administrators to create scheduling periods (known internally as “bids”, “bid periods”, or some variant thereof). Users will then receive an email notification letting them know when it is their turn to bid for their desired time slot on the schedule. The application was created for Pinecrest Police Department by my teammate Otto-Gonzalez and I for our senior project at FIU. This service was created as part of a wide effort within the department to transition to electronic methods of performing their operations.

### Current System
Currently, many police departments handle scheduling manually using paper and spreadsheets. Bidding is done on paper using forms given out to the officers when it is their turn. After the forms are collected it is input into an Excel spreadsheet to ensure that each shift is meeting minimum staffing requirements. The resulting schedules for each shift are then printed into three ring binders, and any amendments are made using white-out and pen.

### Purpose of New System
The purpose of the new system is mainly to relieve the tedium involved with the current manual methods. An all-in-one online system would be more efficient, less wasteful, and significantly easier to manage for the officers in charge of scheduling.
