1) [done] Insert dummy data into the subcategory_bid_order table
2) [doneish] make MY_date_helper function comments easier to read
3) [done] Dummy data on user table, user "Julian Acosta" needs a new hire_date
4) time_slot table: convert all 0s into "NULL" text.
5) allow time_slot userID key to be NULL
6) create a base case for the dummy_data interpreter for the string "NULL"
7) fix time slot table with bid schedule = 3 (there are 2 bid slots referencing user with user id 2)
    because unique key (of 2 attributes) wasn't added to the table yet.
8) create a bid status table because of this scenario:
    a user has not voted given the amount of time that he had... causes infinite loop if administrators
    don't deal with it.
9) time_slot table should allow for NULL times. These NULL values represent implied times by the shift they belong to.
10) 
11) convert v0.5 of time_slot table's userIDs from 0 to NULL
12) remove utn_join_users, along with other queries, and compile them into a view instead
    for view_my_open_schedule controller.
